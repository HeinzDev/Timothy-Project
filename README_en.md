# Timothy Project

Welcome to the Timothy Project, a ReactJS application designed to create a shared list of games among friends. The platform enables users to add comments, each accompanied by a unique profile and various personalities, all presented with a modern design. The backend is powered by Node.js with a MongoDB database cluster.
